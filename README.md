![react-easy-sort-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2678610/107036435-f27fbb00-67b9-11eb-8e3f-72a000586d35.gif)

The goal of this component is to allow sorting elements with drag and drop.

It is mobile friendly by default. It doesn't block scrolling the page when swiping inside it:
the user needs to press an item during at least 200ms to start the drag gesture.

On non-touch devices, the drag gesture only starts after moving an element by at least one pixel.
This is done to avoid blocking clicks on clickable elements inside an item.

## Features

- Supports horizontal and vertical lists
- Supports grid layouts
- Mobile-friendly
- IE11 support 🙈

## Installation

```

or

```shell
npm install react-easy-sort --save
```

## Basic usage

```js
import SortableList, { SortableItem } from 'react-easy-sort'
import { arrayMoveImmutable } from 'array-move'

const App = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'])

  const onSortEnd = (oldIndex: number, newIndex: number) => {
    setItems((array) => arrayMoveImmutable(array, oldIndex, newIndex))
  }

  return (
    <SortableList onSortEnd={onSortEnd} className="list" draggedItemClassName="dragged">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <SortableItem key={item}>
          <div className="item">{item}</div>
        </SortableItem>
      ))}
    </SortableList>

| ------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: | --------------: |

| **onSortEnd\***          |       Called when the user finishes a sorting gesture.       | `(oldIndex: number, newIndex: number) => void` |               - |
| **draggedItemClassName** |           Class applied to the item being dragged            |                    `string`                    |               - |
| **lockAxis**             |            Determines if an axis should be locked            |                 `'x'` or `'y'`                 |                 |
| **allowDrag**            |           Determines whether items can be dragged            |                   `boolean`                    |          `true` |
| **customHolderRef**      | Ref of an element to use as a container for the dragged item |     `React.RefObject<HTMLElement \| null>`     | `document.body` |
| **dropTarget**           |             React element to use as a dropTarget             |                  `ReactNode`                   |                 |

### SortableItem

This component doesn't take any other props than its child. This child should be a single React element that can receives a ref. If you pass a component as a child, it needs to be wrapped with `React.forwardRef()`.

### SortableKnob

You can use this component if you don't want the whole item to be draggable but only a specific area of it.

```js
import SortableList, { SortableItem, SortableKnob } from 'react-easy-sort'
import arrayMove from 'array-move'

const App = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = React.useState(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I'])

  const onSortEnd = (oldIndex: number, newIndex: number) => {
    setItems((array) => arrayMove(array, oldIndex, newIndex))
  }

  return (
    <SortableList onSortEnd={onSortEnd} className="list" draggedItemClassName="dragged">
      {items.map((item) => (
        <SortableItem key={item}>
          <div className="item">
            <SortableKnob>
              <div>Drag me</div>
            </SortableKnob>
            {item}
          </div>
        </SortableItem>
      ))}
    </SortableList>
  )
}
```

This component doesn't take any other props than its child. This child should be a single React element that can receive a ref. If you pass a component as a child, it needs to be wrapped with `React.forwardRef()`.

## Recommended CSS rules

To disable browser default behaviors that can interfer with the dragging experience, we recommend adding the following declarations on the "items":

- `user-select: none;`: disable the selection of content inside the item (the blue box)
- `pointer-events: none;`: required for some browsers if your items contain images (see the [Interactive avatars demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-easy-sort-images-demo-486qk))

## Development

```shell
yarn
yarn start
```

Now, open `http://localhost:3001/index.html` and start hacking!

## Alternatives

- https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc : before creating this library, I was using it and it was also supporting grid layouts. However, we had a lot of errors reported to our Sentry and this project was not maintained anymore.
- https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd: another great library for sorting items. However, it doesn't support grid layouts (as of 2021-02-05).
